       Why the name, BikeBingle?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Well the 'Bike' is obviously short for Bicycle. Depending on
       where you originate the 'Bingle' reference may be slightly more obscure,
       bingle is Australian slang for for an accident/collision/crash. Sorry if
       you thought this web app was a merging of Cycling and Baseball (bingle
       also refers to a base hit, whatever that is ;-) ).

    <div id="FAQ_reportToOfficial">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Is BikeBingle an official means of reporting accidents?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       <b>No</b>.  I can't stress this enough, BikeBingle is not intended to be a
       an official reporting mechanism.  Please be sure to notify the relevant authorities
       in the event of any accident.

    <div id="FAQ_canLink">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Can I reference a specific accident directly?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Yes. just click the map icon of the accident you wish to reference and the popup 
       information window for this accident will be displayed.  In this window copy the 
       link from the 'BikeBingle link' text field.  This URL allows you to reference this
       accident directly from any website. 
    </p>

    <div id="FAQ_whichAccidentType">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       I rode over a pothole that snapped my forks in two causing me to fly over the
       bars into a nearby pedestrian. So which accident type do I select?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       It's subjective and I'll leave it up to your best judgement as to what was the
       most contributing factor to the accident.  In this example I'd say the accident
       was caused by the large pothole, and thats what you should select.  The forks
       failing and the crashing into the unfortunate pedestrian are merely consequences
       of hitting the pothole.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Other incidents may not be so clear cut, if you feel that your accident cannot
       be catagorised into any of the types select 'Other' and enter a description of 
       what happened.  In fact it would be great if you left a description of the 
       incident even if you did find an appropriate type.

    <div id="FAQ_wrongSideOfRoad">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Why do some of the BikeBingle accident type images show the cyclist/vehicles 
       on the wrong side of the road?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Once again you'll have to make allowances for us Australian's, we drive on
       the left hand side of the road.  When selecting a relevant accident type please
       try to interpret the figure taking this into consideration.  I've attempted to
       generate type names and descriptions that are not specific to the side of the
       road that is driven on.

    <div id="FAQ_whyGoogleLogin">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Why do I need to use my Google login to add data?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Google make it very easy to incorporate their login mechanism into applications
       built on the Google App Engine framework (BikeBingle is built on App Engine).  This
       reduces the amount of development work required and also saves you from needing to
       create a new login for every web app out there.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       The only information that BikeBingle obtains from the Google login is the users 
       email/Google id.  Google does not, for obvious reasons, provide the password to
       any application built using App Engine.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="FAQ_whatAreUserDetailsFor">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       What is my user login used for?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       You login id is stored in the BikeBingle database along with the other data you
       provide via the 'Add' interface.  This enables users to manage the data they 
       provide to BikeBingle.  Should you delete all your data from BikeBingle, no 
       references to your user will be maintained.  BikeBingle will never use your 
       email address to contact you for any purpose.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="FAQ_whyArePlusesShown">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Why are only '+' icons displayed when I zoom out? 
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       This functionality was implemented to enhance scalability.  During testing it was discovered that 
       the maximum number of icons that could be displayed at any one time was around the 400 mark. 
       Obviously this number would be exceeded if the user choose to zoom out to an extent covering the 
       entire world.  The simple solution would have been to stop displaying points when the user zoomed
       out too far, but I really wanted to see all points from around the world.  In order to keep the 
       number of displayed points to a minimum and allow the user to see points when zoomed out, different
       levels of detail are displayed.  The further the user zooms out the courser the results returned 
       are, so instead of displaying 50 icons on top of each other one '+' icon is displayed to indicate
       the group.   
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       If you wish to see the bingles that make up one of the '+' icons, simply zoom in on that location.  
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="FAQ_blockingPopups">
    <b class="boldHeadings">
       Why does nothing happen when I click on the 'Related link' buttons?
    </b>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Most likely your blocking popups, BikeBingle attempts to open a new browser 
       window with the related link.  Adding an exclusion for BikeBingle will prevent
       this from happening in future.
