	<h3 class="h3Headings">Concept</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       The basic concept of BikeBingle is to enable cyclists from around the world
       to log and geo-tag any accidents they have.  Over time it is hoped (err, maybe
       hoped isn't the best word) that a significant database will 
       be built up.  As all incidents are geo-tagged users can view the accident 
       history of a specific location.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Such functionality may be of use to a commuter planning a new route as BikeBingle
       may assist in helping the cyclist to avoid the most accident prone locations. It
       may also be of benefit to be made aware of specific dangers at a given location, 
       for example a troublesome pothole that has caused a few 'off's', frequent doorings
       along a stretch of road, and so on.
    </p>
    <p  class="paragraphs">
       BikeBingle is not intended to replace formal reporting of bicycle accidents, it is 
       important for the relevant authorities to collect accurate statistics so that
       action can be taken if deemed necessary.  It is hoped that BikeBingle will fill the
       reporting gap in official channels whereby minor accidents are not reported.  This 
       may be a result of several factors; the cyclist involved may not warrent the accident 
       as significant enough to report, or be unaware that they should report such incidents.

    <div id="Introduction_motivation">
	<h3 class="h3Headings">Motivation</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       After my first few bingles (accidents) I though it would be interesting to keep track of where, 
       when, why and how they happened.  It was really only done for curiosities sake.
       This was very easy to do via Google Maps, but did have its limitations, the big one
       being there was no means to collaborate on a large scale.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       The solution was of course to develop BikeBingle.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Introduction_implementation">
	<h3 class="h3Headings">Implementation</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       BikeBingle is hosted on the Google App Engine framework, this has served to
       be an excellent development platform.  Furthermore the free bandwidth and CPU 
       usage quotas mean that BikeBingle has cost nothing but time.  Big thanks
       to Google for providing the resources to turn an idea into reality with no
       capital required.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       Given Google's reliability I'm betting the App Engine framework will be supported for
       a long time to come.  BikeBingle is in good hands.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       The user interface was created using the Google Web Toolkit. This was great 
       for a guy that could write a Java Swing app in his sleep, but was yet to jump into the
       world of Web 2.0.
    </p>

    <div id="Introduction_futurePlans">
	<h3 class="h3Headings">Future Plans</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       I've got lots, some I really wanted to squeeze into the initial launch of BikeBingle but 
       unfortunately got cut.  Instead of dragging out the development timeline I though it 
       best to get something out and see what you,
       the user, would like to see.  So on the Help panel you'll find a feedback button, which 
       is really just a link to the BikeBingle blog where you can leave feedback.  Good or
       bad, it's all appreciated.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       On the off chance I do get board you may find some graph
       functionality appear, BikeBingle gadgets and some view filters (by date range, injury severity,
       etc).  I'd also like to do some documentation of the web-server with the aim that other web
       apps could be developed to extract information out of the BikeBingle database.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Introduction_blog">
	<h3 class="h3Headings">Blog</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">
       I don't plan on updating this page much, if at all.  Instead I've created the 
       <a href="http://bikebingle.blogspot.com/">BikeBingle blog</a>, with the intention of 
       updating it with all the latest developments.
